This is currently a work in progress that can be viewed at [beer.topset.co](beer.topset.co).

The WeWork Beer list let's WeWork members view and update beers across both Dumbo Heights locations, with a Rails backend designed to scale across all the WeWork campuses.

Deliberately simple in its design and functionality, the beer list is a collaborative effort allowing users to report empty kegs and also keep them up to date.

Users can select from a dropdown database of all available beers to update any beer they want within the system.

To prevent exploitation of the system, beer locations can only be added by administrators.
